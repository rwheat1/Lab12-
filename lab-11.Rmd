### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
```

### Exercise 1

Each case is one baby in North Carolina. Thus, each variable describes something that applies to that baby: the age of their mother/father, their weight, etc. There are a total of 1,000 babies in this dataframe.


```{r exercise-1}

data(ncbirths)
view(ncbirths)

```

### Exercise 2

The average white baby weighs 7.25 pounds.

```{r exercise-2}

ncbirths_white <- ncbirths %>%
  filter(whitemom == "white")

mean_weight <- mean(ncbirths_white$weight)

mean_weight
```


Add exercise headings as needed.
